# Getting Started


**Important**: It should go without saying that anytime you are asked to create an account you should ALWAYS:
* Make sure to use a professional username/handle. We recommend the username incorporates your name. 
* Be sure to add an appropriate avatar to your profile. 

## In your Notebook

Be sure to write down any passwords you create for any of these accounts on a special page of your notenook. (This way you can keep track of your Admin password for MySQL, which I guarantee you will otherwise forget.)
